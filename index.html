              <p>The maze runner is a book that was written in 2009 that turned in a movie. Here is a small summary:</p>
        <p> he sixteen-year-old Thomas wakes up in an industrial elevator (De Box) with no memories, later he only remembers his name. The elevator takes him up and forms in De Glade, a world surrounded by large gray walls. Some sixty teenage boys got there in the same way and learned to survive in a completely closed environment. They call themselves the Gladers. Every thirty days a new boy comes from new stock.The way De Glade takes three years to escape into the Maze that surrounds their living space. The fastest are mentioned who find a way during the day in the maze (De Maze), but because then the gates have to be closed. So far, no one has spent a night in the maze. At night, Grievers roam the maze. Grievers are a kind of arachnid monsters. Their stings are dead. At one point there are also Grievers walking around in the maze during the day. Thomas manages to kill a Griever and the Glade's leader, Alby, too red, especially who is also burned. The Box the first girl that sends Thomas progress. A note in her hand says she will be "the last one ever".</p>
